This tool is intended to simplify the setup of various tools and configuration of a kali machine after a fresh installation and save unnecessary time, so that a predefined list can be used in advance or you can also create your own.<br />

The name `Yggdrasil` comes from norse mythology and is the tree of life or world tree, here the name is quite appropriate for the concept of the program, as it is geared for several pentetration test areas or even for digital forensics.<br />
<br />

> [!IMPORTANT]
> <strong>Please do `not` use the program `for illegal intentions`.</strong><br />
